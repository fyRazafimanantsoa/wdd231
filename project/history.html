          <h2>The Beginning</h2>
          <pre>
            I started this page on July 25th as a way to share my journey into frontend development.
            It all began with a spark of curiosity and lots of practice!
            Right now, I’m still very much at the beginning of this path. This is actually my very first project, and to
            be honest, I’m still figuring things out as I go. Every new line of code feels like a small challenge, and
            sometimes I have to read or watch tutorials over and over until it makes sense. 
  
            Some days, I make progress other days, I get stuck on things that seem simple for others. But I know that
            learning is a process, and I’m trying to enjoy the journey, even if it’s slow.
            I built this page not because I’ve mastered frontend development, but because I wanted to start somewhere and
            share the real experience of learning from scratch. This project isn’t perfect but it’s mine, and it’s
            helping me grow step by step.
  
            If you’re also learning or just starting out, I hope this reminds you that it’s okay not to have it all
            figured out yet. We’ll get there, one line of code at a time!

          <h2>Overcoming Challenges</h2>
          <pre>
            I encountered several challenges from responsive design issues to debugging complex code.
            Each obstacle was a stepping stone to growth.
  
            Sometimes it felt frustrating when things didn’t work the way I expected, especially when even small mistakes
            could break the whole layout or function. There were moments I spent hours trying to fix a problem, only to
            realize it was caused by a missing semicolon or a typo!
  
            But little by little, I’ve started to understand that this is part of the learning process. Every bug I fix
            and every error I correct helps me get more comfortable with coding. I’m still working through challenges, and
            I know there are many more to come, but I’m learning not to give up when things get tough.
  
            With every issue I solve, I gain a bit more confidence. This project has taught me that persistence matters
            even more than talent, and that real growth comes from not quitting, no matter how confusing or difficult the
            code may seem.

          <h2>Milestones &amp; Successes</h2>
          <pre>
            Every new feature and improvement represented a milestone. Creating interactive elements and mastering layout
            design were rewarding achievements.
  
            Even though I’m still in the early stages of learning, I’ve had a few small wins that felt really big to me
            like getting my first navigation bar to work, making a form responsive, or seeing my CSS changes reflect
            exactly as I planned. These little victories remind me that progress is happening, even if it’s slow.
  
            I’m still exploring and practicing, and there’s so much more I want to learn especially about JavaScript,
            layout techniques, and making my projects feel more polished. But for now, I’m proud of each piece I’ve
            managed to build, knowing that these small steps are leading me closer to becoming confident in frontend
            development.

          <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
          <pre>
            My journey continues as I explore new technologies and push the boundaries of design and development. I hope
            my story inspires you to embark on your own coding adventure.
  
            I’m still figuring things out, step by step this is only the beginning of my path as a frontend developer.
            There’s a lot I haven’t mastered yet, and some concepts still feel confusing, but I’m committed to learning
            and growing with every project I build.
  
            I’m excited to see how much I can improve over time, and I’m looking forward to the day when I can look back
            at this first project and see how far I’ve come. For now, the journey continues and I’m grateful for every
            lesson along the way.
